## Project Motivation:
To practice vanilla JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, event handling, and project planning.

## What I Learned:
*Key Technologies/Techniques in Brief*: Vanilla Javascript, DOM manipulation, event listeners, objects. CSS styling.

This project was completed in order to consolidate the fundamentals of vanilla JavaScript that I have learned thus far (i.e.., JavaScript strings, conditionals, functions, objects, DOM Manipulation, and event handling). In addition, it was a great chance to flex my CSS muscles; in particular, I had fun styling the calculator using a neumorphic design.

Most importantly, however, was the problem solving and project planning I completed before I actually began to write the JavaScript code. I created several iterations of flow diagrams and spent significant time thinking about the logic behind the program. This allowed me to identify the key tasks and functions needed to make the calculator work. Thus, when I actually went to write the code, I had a fairly decent idea of what to do. Of course, there were still some unexpected bugs and edge cases that I had to deal with on the fly, but I think they were lessened considerably by this prior preparation.

## Further Improvements:
As with my previous projects, the code for this project is still fairly long and not as organized as I would like it to be. Once I study code organization and design patterns, I will return to this project and refactor it to make it more organized and simpler.

Keyboard support is only partially complete; I will revisit this at some point, though it is not an immediate priority.

This project has poor mobile support; I will fix that once I learn more about mobile compatibility.
